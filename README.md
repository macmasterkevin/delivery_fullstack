# Delivery Devil

DeliveryDevil, is a provider of delivery services for delivery orders.

A driver uses either a pc or a mobile phone to visit the DeliveryDevil website. On this site, they can see each order that they are expected to deliver.

The information that they care about is when did the order come in, what restaurant is the delivery from, who is it going to, and whether or not the customer has tipped the last few delivery drivers. A delivery person probably cares where the restaurant is, how much to collect on the order, the address of the customer and their tipping history. 

Build views that show the relevant information. Write Restful API endpoints in C# to obtain the information. Write the associated data access using Entity Framework.

Our goal is to get a complete function from endpoint to html. You can achieve this by building html on the server or using any client side framework (preferably React.js). 
The code that you submit should be functionally correct and satisfy the requirements. The scope of this exercise is mainly backend. Feel free to stub out anything that is not interesting. 

### Submission

Please submit your code for review once completed. Happy coding!
